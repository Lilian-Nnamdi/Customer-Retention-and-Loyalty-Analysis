# Analysis of sales transaction data with a focus on customer segmentation with RFM and cohort analysis (customer retention)
A Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) analysis was carried out and customers were grouped into 5 segments, with this, we were able to see the best customers and the weakest customers. This analysis is good so that we can target different customer groups and send messages and advertisement that will be better suited for each customer group. It will also be good to look for ways to convert the almost inactive customers, probably by offering discounts on selected products and sending messages on special offers, etc.

### Questions/Conclusions
##### Country with the highest sales
The United Kingdom has the highest sales with about 83% of revenue coming from the United Kingdom. This is a bit of a monopoly because they have stores in 40 countries, it means that if the UK site was to go down for any reason, the revenue of the company will be affected greatly. We need to think of ways to improve sales in the other countries to balance out the revenue to an extent. Also some countries are not generating enough revenue, this is a cost to the business because they have operating costs in those countries too. We need to improve sales here probably through advertising, knowing what product sells the most in those countries and the like.
##### Weekday with the most sales
The month of November has the highest sales and thursdays have the highest sales too
##### Are customers being retained or are most of them churning out ?
A cohort analysis was done to check the retention rate of customers. For customers who were acquired in January, the retention rate after each month was almost at 40% - 50% but that number went down gradually for the new customers. The retention rate generally became about 20% after the first purchase. I would recommend that we improve the customer retention strategies by sending engaging emails, improving customer support, getting customer feedback, automating where necessary etc.
